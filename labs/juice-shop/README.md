# Juice Shop lab wall

Local OWASP Juice Shop only. Hypothetical shop. Not a live bounty program.

Current wall: see `versions.json` (`wall`). Hunt that overlay, then harden a **new** overlay so the next hunt is strictly harder.

| Overlay | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `overlays/v0-stock/` | Unmodified `bkimminich/juice-shop` |
| `overlays/v1-hardened/` | Edge proxy: security headers, login rate limit, extra-file path closed |

```bash
# stock
docker compose -f labs/juice-shop/overlays/v0-stock/docker-compose.yml up

# current wall (v1)
docker compose -f labs/juice-shop/overlays/v1-hardened/docker-compose.yml up
```

In-scope URL stays `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Fail-closed: no recon/score without `programs/juice-shop/scope.md`.

Do not auto-pwn. Score is GET `/api/Challenges` solved/total. 0/N is valid if the CASE report path still works.
